    "## What is a Binary Search Tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Binary Search Tree** or **BST** is a unique data structure that looks like a family tree. Each element in the tree is called a **node**, and stores some sort of chronological data - be it alphabetical or numerical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **topmost node** on level 0 is also called the **root node**. The node(s) on the **lowest level** is called a **leaf / leaves**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the diagram below, the root node is 7, and the leaves are 1, 5 and 14.\n",
    "\n",

    "## How does a BST organize its data?\n",
    "A BST organizes its data such that nodes in the **left subtree** of a node A are **smaller in value than** or **precedes** that of A. The diagram above shows that nodes with data 1, 2 and 5 are in the left subtree of the root node, which has a value of 7. Similarly, the node with value 2 has the node with value 1 in its left subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, the right subtree of a node A contains nodes of values **larger than** or **succeeding** that of node A. Check out the right subtree of the root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do take note that subtree nodes of node A are also called **children nodes** of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Traversing a BST i.e. exploring the data\n",
    "In computing, there are four main ways of traversing through a BST, and these can also be split into two search categories.. We'll use Figure 1 as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH explores the tree as far down as possible in  abranch, before backtracking to the nearest node with an unexplored branch:\n",
    "    *   PREORDER TRAVERSAL looks at the parent, left child then right child. Based on Figure 1 above, the traversal would be: 7, 2, 1, 5, 9, 14.\n",
    "    *   INORDER TRAVERSAL looks at the left child, parent then right child. The traversal in Figure 1 would be: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 14. \n",
    "    *   POSTORDER TRAVERSAL looks at the left child, right child then the parent. The traversal in Figure 1 would be: 1, 5, 2, 14, 9, 7.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "*   BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH explores node on each level, from root to leaves. This is also called LEVELORDER TRAVERSAL, so the traversal in Figure 1 would be: 7, 2, 9, 1, 5, 14\n"

    "## Building a BST\n",
    "Every time you try to insert a new Node into a BST, the node will be arranged such that the BST is as described in **How does a BST organize its data?**.\n",

    "That means you need a way to **create a new node**,  **check the value of the nodes** as you traverse, and **assign the parent and child nodes** to each other.\n",
