# Coding_From_Scratch

Hello! I'm Ainul Mardhiyyah, an engineering graudate from Singapore University of Technology and Design.

As part of my 2019 preparation for coding interviews for graduate programs and roles in tech, I compiled implementations of data structures and algorithms - cheatsheets and template codes basically - into a single "folder" or repo

Below is a checklist of topics - including those that I am currently working on. Feel free to squeeze in some last minute pull requests for Hacktoberfest!
