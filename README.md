# Coding_From_Scratch
Hello! I'm Ainul Mardhiyyah, a Class of 2020 Information Systems undergrad at the Singapore University of Technology and Design.

As part of my preparation for coding interviews for 2020 graduate programs and roles in tech, I'm compiling implementations of data structures and algorithms - cheatsheets and template codes basically.
